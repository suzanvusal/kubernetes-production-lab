# Kubernetes Production Lab

A production-style Kubernetes platform project focused on real-world operational patterns, security, observability, and scalability.

This repository is built incrementally, following daily improvements to demonstrate how Kubernetes platforms are designed, deployed, and operated in professional environments.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design Kubernetes workloads using production best practices
- Implement namespace isolation and RBAC
- Deploy stateless and stateful applications
- Enable autoscaling, observability, and logging
- Apply security controls and policy enforcement
- Introduce GitOps-style deployment workflows

This is **not a tutorial repo** — it is a hands-on platform engineering lab.
