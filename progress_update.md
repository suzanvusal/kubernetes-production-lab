🚀 Kubernetes Production Lab.

A production-grade Kubernetes platform lab designed to simulate real-world enterprise cluster architecture, security, and platform engineering best practices.

🗓 Day 1 — Cluster Foundation & Tooling Setup
Goal:

Build a solid local Kubernetes foundation and prepare for production-grade workflows.

What We Implemented:

Installed and configured:

kubectl

helm

k9s

kind (Kubernetes in Docker)

Created a multi-node Kubernetes cluster using Kind

Verified cluster health and connectivity

Established baseline tooling used by real SRE & Platform Engineering teams

Skills Demonstrated:

Kubernetes cluster bootstrapping

Toolchain standardization

Local production simulation

Kubernetes CLI operations

🗓 Day 2 — GitOps Repository Structure & Platform Layout
Goal:

Design a clean, scalable repository architecture aligned with GitOps and enterprise Kubernetes standards.

What We Implemented:

Designed full repo structure:

kubernetes-production-lab/
  clusters/
  namespaces/
  rbac/
  workloads/
  networking/
  observability/
  security/
  helm/


Established platform vs workload separation

Structured repo for:

Scalability

Security boundaries

Environment isolation

GitOps workflows

Skills Demonstrated:

GitOps repository design

Platform engineering workflows

Production-grade repo architecture

Kubernetes configuration management

🗓 Day 3 — Namespace Architecture & Environment Isolation
Goal:

Design production-grade namespace isolation model.

What We Implemented:

Created layered namespace architecture:

platform       → cluster services
observability  → logging & monitoring
security       → policies & scanning
dev            → development workloads
staging        → pre-production workloads
prod           → production workloads


Applied labels for:

Workload classification

Security boundaries

Policy targeting

Deployed namespaces using Kubernetes manifests

Why This Matters:

Enables:

Strong security isolation

Resource governance

Team boundaries

Compliance controls

Skills Demonstrated:

Kubernetes multi-tenant design

Namespace isolation

Production environment modeling

Cluster governance design

🗓 Day 4 — RBAC & Least-Privilege Security Model
Goal:

Implement enterprise-grade Kubernetes security controls.

What We Implemented:
1️⃣ Platform Admin Access

Created platform-admin service account

Bound to cluster-admin role

Reserved for SRE / Platform Engineering teams

2️⃣ Developer Read-Only Access

Namespace-scoped read-only permissions

Prevents destructive operations

Enforces least privilege model

3️⃣ CI/CD Deployment Identity

Created cicd-deployer service account

Granted scoped permissions:

Create / Update / Delete workloads only

Enables secure automated deployments

Why This Matters:

This matches real enterprise Kubernetes security architecture.

Skills Demonstrated:

Kubernetes RBAC

Service Account management

Security architecture design

Least privilege implementation

Production access control modeling

##Day 5-8
mplement Zero Trust Networking using Kubernetes Network Policies to:

Block all traffic by default

Allow only explicitly permitted communication

Enforce strict environment isolation

Build microsegmentation controls

#Artitecture Target ->
dev namespace
   ├── Only allow ingress from:
   │      - same namespace
   │      - ingress controllers
   └── Deny everything else

staging namespace
   ├── Isolated from dev & prod

prod namespace
   ├── Strict isolation
   └── Only production ingress allowed
